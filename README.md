# React Number Guessing Game

Just a simple guessing game built in React. Guess the number between the minimum and maximum bounds. You can customize the bounds too.

### How to run
- `git clone https://github.com/davidgtu/react-number-guesser.git`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

### Things to be improved upon

#### Testing (!!!)
I've never done testing in React before. I've attempted in this challenge, but due to the holidays, time was a bit of a challenge. However, I've done a bit of research and will be slowly updating this with best practices of React testing.

#### Implementation Details
There were some things that I wasn't too sure that belonged in a component with state. Such as: Does the `message` state deserve to be in the `Input` component? Should that be it's own component with state? Things like this I need to things about and work on.

#### Design
I wanted to spruce things up with color, but I thought being minimal is best. That said, some of the layout and styling could be improved upon, personally.
